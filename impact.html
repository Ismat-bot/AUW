        <p>
          After graduating with a degree in Biology from AUW, I returned to my community in Nepal. Unable to comply with the discriminatory and patriarchal norms there, I instinctively chose to work for social reformation. I am leading a partnership project between AUW and Nepal Jesuit Social Initiative to recruit 15 girls from high trafficking-prone regions of Nepal to study at AUW through Pathways for Promise.

      <p>
        When a woman is educated, it is not only an individual that feels the results. Families, villages, and nations are positively affected by a woman‚Äôs education and the choices she makes because of that opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since 2008, we have provided exceptional higher education to almost 2,000 current students and alumnae. Like Christina, 75 percent of graduates return to their home countries to make visible impact in their communities. The other 25 percent are empowered to continue their education at internationally-recognized graduate schools. Wherever they are, AUW alumnae and students are at the forefront of change in their communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        To achieve change, women must be given a chance. Women who lack extraordinary talent can be found in even the most marginalized and vulnerable communities. At AUW, we empower women not only from refugee camps, but plantations, garment factories, tea estates, conflict zones, and urban slums. What they all have in common is a deep resolve to transform not just their own lives, but their families and communities through a purposeful education for purpose. When education is their right, beyond inclusion comes real impact.

        <p>
          Everybody has moments of equality at the tip of their tongue, but not necessarily in their head, heart and hands. If people don‚Äôt embody those moments with intention, beliefs about transformation and equality are invisible. Together, we must do the incredibly hard work of making the invisible visible.
